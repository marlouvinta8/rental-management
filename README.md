The Rental Management System is a web-based application developed using PHP, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. It is designed to simplify the rental process for boarders.

Through the system, boarders can view available units and rent directly from the website. The system also allows boarders to track their monthly payments and view their payment history. Additionally, they can submit maintenance requests for any issues related to their rented units.
